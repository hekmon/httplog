// Header returns the header map that will be sent by
// [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader]. The [Header] map also is the mechanism with which
// [Handler] implementations can set HTTP trailers.
//
// Changing the header map after a call to [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] (or
// [ResponseWriter.Write]) has no effect unless the HTTP status code was of the
// 1xx class or the modified headers are trailers.
//
// There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
// predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
// send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
// trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
// keys not known to the [Handler] until after the first [ResponseWriter.Write],
// is to prefix the [Header] map keys with the [TrailerPrefix]
// constant value.
//
// To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
// their value to nil.
func (rw *ResponseWriter) Header() http.Header {

// Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
//
// If [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] has not yet been called, Write calls
// WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
// does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
// to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
// [DetectContentType]. Additionally, if the total size of all written
// data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
// Content-Length header is added automatically.
//
// Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
// Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
// Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
// needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
// handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
// writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
// by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
// possible to maximize compatibility.

// If WriteHeader is not called explicitly, the first call to Write

// send error codes or 1xx informational responses.
//
// The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
// Any number of 1xx headers may be written, followed by at most
// one 2xx-5xx header. 1xx headers are sent immediately, but 2xx-5xx
// headers may be buffered. Use the Flusher interface to send
// buffered data. The header map is cleared when 2xx-5xx headers are
// sent, but not with 1xx headers.

// The server will automatically send a 100 (Continue) header
// on the first read from the request body if the request has
// an "Expect: 100-continue" header.
